OpenSimRoot is a functional-structural open-source model. It simulate the root system architecture over time and is coupled 
to a soil model. This model compute the nutrient and water uptake of the plant. 

OpenSimRoot contains a command line interface, minimodels and plugins. The design of OpenSimRoot allows the implementation
of new minimodels without a deepknowledge of the C++ code wich is an asset for developers and scientists who want to use OpenSimRoot in
their own way.

This model has an enormous range of applications such as geometric analysis of root system form and function, simulation of processes too 
difficult to measure empirically, sensitivity analyses,... 

petit phrase qui explique qu'on continuera de travailler sur le mod√®le: 

In the incomming weeks we are going to dig further in this model and show you the roaps of it ! 

Bribri, la longueur du texte est suffisante ? je ne sais pas trop ce que peut contenir un GIF :/
