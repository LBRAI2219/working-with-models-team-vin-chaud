on their website:
"OpenSimRoot is a 3D architectural plant model. It simulated the growth of a root system
over time in a 3D virtual space and is coupled to a 3D soil model, to compute water and
nutrient uptake by the use of functional structural models.

OpenSimRoot as a research tool allows us to study the effect of a specific root trait on
resource acquisition, so that we can study the importance of a trait under multiple
resource constraints.

A benefit of OpenSimRoot is its modular program structure. It is now fully C++ and relies
only on standard libraries. To run your root simulation you specify a XML input file to give a
parameterization."
