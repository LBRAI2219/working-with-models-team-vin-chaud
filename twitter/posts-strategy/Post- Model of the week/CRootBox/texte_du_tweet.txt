CRootBox is a root architecture model. It has an object oriented implementation in C++ with python binding that give a great flexibility of uses.
For example, it allows you to simulate:
-free growth of individual root
-growth of roots in a container
-field scale simulation
-root growth with static soil condition
-water uptake and flow in roots and soil by coupling CRootBox with Soil Physics
They've also created a database with the parameters of their simulation in an unconfined space.
