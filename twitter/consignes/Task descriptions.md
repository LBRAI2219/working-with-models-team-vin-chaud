# Assignment Task/Brief and Assessment Criteria

In a small group, you will create and curate a professional modelling-themed 'Twitter' account. This will give you experience in communicating science, and will create a group-sourced repository of resources covering current modelling topics, helping you with your reading. 

You will:
       
- Collaboratively develop a sustainable social media posting strategy and schedule. You will be able to do this during the lecture slot, to make it easier for groups to meet. 

- Identify, explain and critically evaluate high-quality resources such as science news articles, primary or review science papers, explanatory websites, engaging videos, or other media. Your content should draw upon the topics discussed in the lectures, and increasingly connect topics and themes from di erent weeks.


- Your tweets should have a short explanation or commentary - do not just copy and paste a URL and its title. You can use Twitter's 'thread' function to expand the character limit (you can thread your tweets by replying to your own tweets).

- Engage with the other module Twitter accounts and other Twitter users through re-tweets and replies.

- Evaluate your account's impact and reach using Twitter's analysis function and specialist websites.

Your final mark will consist of two components:

1) An electronic portfolio of all of your individual tweets in a Storify document, submitted electronically for anonymous marking via TurnitIn by Tuesday Week 9, 23.55 pm. This will be graded by the module leader and have a weight of 50% for your  nal coursework mark.

2) Anonymous peer assessment of your group Twitter account (deadline for feedback emailed to module leader is Tuesday Week 9, 23.55 pm). Each group will assess the other groups using a marking pro forma. The module leader will calculate the average peer mark, which has a weight of 50% for your  nal coursework mark.
