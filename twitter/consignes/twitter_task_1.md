# Twitter task 1: 'Create and follow'

For your first task, arrange to meet as a group somewhere where you have access to a computer.

## Sign up with Twitter

Agree on a catchy name ('Twitter handle') for your professional modelling account, and sign up at [http://www.twitter.com](). Every group member needs to make a note of the login details and password, as the account will be shared between all of you. Please share your Twitter handle with me, but not with the other students. I will share all account names with the class, but not who is curating them. This will allow anonymous peer feedback and rating in Week 10.
