Cuurrently the agriculture is facing a lot of challenges in order to be more sustainable. 
One of the solution is polyculture but does it actually work ? 

The team of M. Postma researched it through the  root architecture of a classic system in the americas: a
polyculture of bean, maize and squash. 

How did they do it ? 
Thanks to a model : OpenSimRoot
It was used to simulate poly and monoculture during the first 40 days. 

The result ? 
Nitrate uptake and biomass production were up to 7% higher in polyculture than in monoculture ! 
The nitrogen uptake was independent of the nitrogen fixation due to the bean. 
They were no differences due to the roots between the two culture in regard of potassium, phosphorus and biomass production. 

they concluded that the difference in root architecture allows polyculture to overyieldwhen there is a competition for mobile nutrients
(and ressources)
