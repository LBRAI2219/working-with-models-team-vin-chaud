Dear ...., 
We are university students at the UCL and for our biological modeling course we interview researchers about there models. 
The goal behind this is to have a better understanding of the model.
Futhermore we present and promote the model. In order to do that, we created a tweeter account and we publish a presentation of the model
followed by a link to the interview that is uploaded on youtube.
Would you like to be interview about your model ..... ? 
Sincerely yours, 

Antoine Rummens and Brieuc Ryelandt
