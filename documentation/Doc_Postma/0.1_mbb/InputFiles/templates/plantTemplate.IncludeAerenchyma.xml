	Simulation file for SimRoot version 5. 

	Author: Jouke Postma
	Note: 
	This file is an include file and contains the plantTemplate. You can control here 
	what parameters are simulated for the plant. It has sections for the whole plant, 
	the shoot, the hypocotyl and the roots and the datapoints (which are the nodes 
	the root is made up from). 
	This file contains the settings for aerenchyma formation in simroot.
